    "section": "",
    "text": "The point guard position in basketball is like the quarterback of a football team. The point guard controls the ball, controls the tempo, and is expected to control the game through all chaos. Think… you’re a coach heading in to game 40 of the season, first round of March Madness. You have a Freshmen guard who has a lot of potential but may not be ready for the bright lights, and a veteran guard who has been in this position for the last three years. Who do you play? Who is going to control the offesne when the lights are the brightest? Coaches are very specific about who they play at their point guard, and many coaches have a preference of having a point guard with experience.\nBy looking at our Power 5 guard statistics over the last seven years, these charts show how age and experience have an affect on the point guard position. The goal is to see whether an experienced point guard is more fit to run point over an underclassmen in conference tournament and March Madness games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ngames15 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs15.csv\") \ngames16 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs16.csv\")\ngames17 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs17.csv\")\ngames18 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs18.csv\")\ngames19 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs19.csv\")\ngames20 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs20.csv\")\ngames21 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs21.csv\")\ngames22 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs22.csv\")\ngames23 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs23.csv\")\ngames24 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs24.csv\")\n\ngames &lt;- bind_rows(games15, games16, games17, games18, games19, games20, games21, games22, games23, games24)\n\nplayers19 &lt;- read_csv(\"players/ncaa_mens_basketball_players19.csv\") |&gt;

Marquette and Michigan State receive the most production from older guard play, which makes sense given the coaches at each university have a trend of developing guards til and playing til their senior year.\n\n\nCode\np5 &lt;- c(\"Big Ten\", \"ACC\", \"SEC\", \"Big 12\",\"Big East\")\nplayer_production &lt;- players |&gt; \n  filter(Conference %in% p5)|&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"G\") |&gt; \n  filter(MP &gt; 1, AST &gt; 100) |&gt; \n  mutate(Production = (PTS + AST) / MP)\n\n\nbest &lt;- player_production |&gt;\n  filter( Production &gt; .70) |&gt;\n  filter(Class == \"JR\" | Class == \"SR\")|&gt; \n filter (MP &gt; 1000)\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=player_production, aes(x = MP, y = Production, color = Class), size = 5) +\n   geom_text_repel(data = best, aes(x = MP, y = Production, label = Player), size = 3)+\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"maroon\",\"lightblue\", \"red\" )) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Do Experienced Guards Produce More in Big Games?\",\n    subtitle = \"Power 5 PG's with over 1000 minutes played and produced at a high level.

The chart only shows players above 850 minutes and a production rate over 0.70, and the group is almsot entirely juniors and seniors . That top percent shows us that older guards are able to perform in big games, and can sustain their play throughout the long season better than younger guards.\n\n\nCode\np5 &lt;- c(\"Big Ten\", \"ACC\", \"SEC\", \"Big 12\", \"Big East\")\n\nTurnRatio &lt;- players |&gt; \n  filter(Conference %in% p5) |&gt; \n  filter(Pos == \"G\") |&gt; \n  filter(MP &gt; 1, AST &gt; 125) |&gt; \n  mutate(TurnRatio = AST / TOV)\n\nyoung_pg &lt;- TurnRatio |&gt; \n  filter(Class == \"FR\" | Class == \"SO\")\n\nold_pg &lt;- TurnRatio |&gt; \n  filter(Class == \"JR\" | Class == \"SR\")\n\n\nggplot() +\ngeom_boxplot(data = young_pg, aes(x = \"Younger PG's\", y = TurnRatio), fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_boxplot(data = old_pg, aes(x = \"Older PG's\", y = TurnRatio), fill = \"red\")  +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Experienced point guards protect the ball better in big games.\",\n    subtitle = \"Assist-to-Turnover ratio among Power 5 guards\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Assist-to-Turnover Ratio\",\n    caption = \"Source: NCAA | By Turner Ahrens\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis box plot shows that older guards don’t turn the ball over as much in big games as younger guards. The higher stake games speed up the tempo and could lead to an inexperienced guard getting rushed. The older guard’s median assist-to-turnover ratio is higher, meaning older guards turn the ball over less while still passing and getting assists. This is huge in postseason play because every possession matters and the point guard is the tone setter."
