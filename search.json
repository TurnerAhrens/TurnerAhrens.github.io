    "text": "The “Notorious” Conor McGregor hit the UFC scene in 2013 and forever changed the trajectory of the sport.Through his antics, his showmanship, and pure skill Conor elevated what people expected from their favorite UFC fighters. McGregor’s fight style and the way he marketed himself was something the UFC scene needed. Whether you liked Conor McGregor or not, you watched. His rise was pivotal for the UFC, because the UFC was really struggling with viewership for a long time. Dana White saw Conor McGregor as more than a fighter and helped elevate him into an international star.\nThe biggest effect Conor had on the sport was the major spike in PPV for his events.McGregor was pulling in numbers we have never seen before and was doing it in multiple ways. Even his pre-fight press conferences and weigh-in’s were generating millions of impressions and views on social media. People were willing to pay the price to watch the Irishman fight.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nufc &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ufc-csv.csv\") |&gt;\n mutate(FightYear = year(Date))\n\nPPVevents &lt;- ufc |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(`PPV-Sales`) == FALSE) |&gt; \n  group_by(`Event-Code`, `Event-Name`, `Date`) |&gt;\n  summarize(PPV_Sales = max(`PPV-Sales`, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  clean_names()\n\nmcgregor_fights &lt;- ufc |&gt;\n  filter(`Full Name` == \"Conor McGregor\" | `Fighter-2-Name` == \"Conor McGregor\")\n\nmcgregor_events &lt;- mcgregor_fights |&gt;\n  group_by(`Event-Code`, `Event-Name`, Date) |&gt;\n  summarize(PPV_Sales = max(`PPV-Sales`, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nbestfight &lt;- mcgregor_events |&gt;\n  filter(PPV_Sales &gt; 2000000)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=PPVevents, aes(x=date, y=ppv_sales, group=1),colour = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = mcgregor_events, aes(x=Date, y = PPV_Sales),colour = \"#169B62\", size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = bestfight, aes(x = Date, y = PPV_Sales, label = `Event-Name`), size = 4)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"McGregor Events Generated the Highest PPV in UFC History\",\n    subtitle = \"PPV(pay-per-view) sales in the UFC had been fluctuating for years until McGregor(shown in green) started\\nfighting.

Something the UFC has never seen before was somebody with the unpredictability of Conor McGregor. You never knew whether he was going to come out and try to end the fight in one round or put on a show for five rounds in a title bout. He had the ability to end a fight in 40 seconds like he did to Donold Cerrone or go deep in the 4th round with the best wrestler ever, Khabib Nurmagomedov. It was different, it was entertaining, and it changed how other fighters fought. People often undermine the fighting ability of McGregor because of his personality, but he was one of the most eletric, fast paced fighters in UFC history.\n\n\nCode\nall_fight_time &lt;- ufc |&gt;\n  group_by(FightYear) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_fight_time = mean(`Total-Fight-Time-Sec`)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nmcgregor_time &lt;- mcgregor_fights |&gt;\n  group_by(FightYear) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_mcgregor_time = mean(`Total-Fight-Time-Sec`)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nall_pivot &lt;- all_fight_time |&gt;\n  rename(Value = avg_fight_time) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"All Fighters\")\n\nmcgregor_pivot &lt;- mcgregor_time |&gt;\n  rename(Value = avg_mcgregor_time) |&gt;\n  mutate(Type = \"McGregor\")\n\ncombined_time &lt;- bind_rows(all_pivot, mcgregor_pivot)\n\nfight_time &lt;- combined_time |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Type,values_from = Value) |&gt;\n  filter(McGregor &gt; 0)   \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(data = fight_time,aes( y = FightYear,x = `All Fighters`,xend = McGregor),size = 3.5,colour = \"grey\",colour_x = \"black\",colour_xend = \"orange\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"McGregor's Unpredictability was Must-See-TV\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing the average fight length in seconds of all UFC fighters(shown in black) to \\nConor McGregor's average fight times per year.

Before McGregor, fights in the UFC had way less action and were way more about trying to make it to a judges decision to win the fight. Conor was one of the first fighters to throw that gameplan out the window, and go all in on “I’m going to throw more punches than you,” he notoriously told Nate Diaz in a press conference. Conor McGregor did not just change the climate of the UFC financially but also changed how other fighters fought. McGregor was getting paid the big bucks to go put on a show and that began a steady growth in striking overall in the UFC. In conclusion, through his ppv sales, figting style, and striking volume, Conor McGregor changed the UFC more then any fighter we have ever seen.\n\n\nCode\n all_sig &lt;- ufc |&gt;\n  filter(FightYear &lt; 2014) |&gt; \n  filter(`Significant-Strike-Attempt` &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_sig_attempt = mean(`Significant-Strike-Attempt`)) |&gt;\n  mutate(FighterType = \"Pre-McGregor UFC average\")\n\nmcgregor_sig &lt;- mcgregor_fights |&gt;\n  filter(`Significant-Strike-Attempt` &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_sig_attempt = mean(`Significant-Strike-Attempt`)) |&gt;\n  mutate(FighterType = \"Conor McGregor\")\n\nsig_both &lt;- bind_rows(all_sig, mcgregor_sig)\n\nbar_sig &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = sig_both,aes(x = reorder(FighterType, avg_sig_attempt), weight = avg_sig_attempt),fill = \"black\") +\n  geom_bar(data = mcgregor_sig,aes(x = FighterType, weight = avg_sig_attempt),fill = \"#169B62\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Average significant strikes attempted\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nall_total &lt;- ufc |&gt;\n  filter(FightYear &lt; 2014) |&gt;\n  filter(`Total-Strikes-Attempt` &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_total_attempt = mean(`Total-Strikes-Attempt`)) |&gt;\n  mutate(FighterType = \"Pre-McGregor UFC average\")\n\nmcgregor_total &lt;- mcgregor_fights |&gt;\n  filter(`Total-Strikes-Attempt` &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_total_attempt = mean(`Total-Strikes-Attempt`)) |&gt;\n  mutate(FighterType = \"Conor McGregor\")\n\ntotal_table &lt;- bind_rows(all_total, mcgregor_total)\n\nbar_total &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = total_table,aes(x = reorder(FighterType, avg_total_attempt), weight = avg_total_attempt),fill = \"black\") +\n  geom_bar(data = mcgregor_total,aes(x = FighterType, weight = avg_total_attempt),fill = \"orange\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Average total strikes attempted\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\nbar_sig + bar_total +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The UFC had never seen a fighter strike like McGregor\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing McGregor’s striking statistics to the UFC fighters before him.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Kaggle (The Ultimate UFC Dataset by Prashanth Saravanan) | By Turner Ahrens\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"

    "text": "The point guard position in basketball is like the quarterback of a football team. The point guard controls the ball, controls the tempo, and is expected to control the game through all chaos. Think… you’re a coach heading in to game 40 of the season, first round of March Madness. You have a Freshmen guard who has a lot of potential but may not be ready for the bright lights, and a veteran guard who has been in this position for the last three years. Who do you play? Who is going to control the offense when the lights are the brightest? Coaches are very specific about who they play at their point guard, and many coaches prefer point guards with experience.\nBy looking at our Power 5 guard statistics over the last seven years, these charts show how age and experience have an affect on the point guard position. The goal is to see whether an experienced point guard is more fit to run point over an underclassmen in conference tournament and March Madness games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ngames15 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs15.csv\") \ngames16 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs16.csv\")\ngames17 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs17.csv\")\ngames18 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs18.csv\")\ngames19 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs19.csv\")\ngames20 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs20.csv\")\ngames21 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs21.csv\")\ngames22 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs22.csv\")\ngames23 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs23.csv\")\ngames24 &lt;- read_csv(\"gamelogs/ncaa_mens_basketball_game_logs24.csv\")\n\ngames &lt;- bind_rows(games15, games16, games17, games18, games19, games20, games21, games22, games23, games24)\n\nplayers19 &lt;- read_csv(\"players/ncaa_mens_basketball_players19.csv\") |&gt;

The higher stake games speed up the tempo and could lead to an inexperienced guard getting rushed. The older guard’s median assist-to-turnover ratio is higher, meaning older guards turn the ball over less while still passing and getting assists. This is huge in postseason play because every possession matters and the point guard is the tone setter."
